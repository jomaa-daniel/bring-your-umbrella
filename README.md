# Arab Tech Collective Resume Project

Welcome to Arab Tech Collective! We're here to propel your career in tech and the first step is a good resume. A unique project that demonstrates your technical acumen is a must have in the interview room. Everyone will take classes and do class projects, but only you will have completed a project built by Google, Amazon, and Meta Engineers!

By the end of this project you will learn:
- **Version Control** managing how to build and maintain a codebase
- **Cloud Infrastructure** developing and deploying code on the cloud
- **Integrations** interacting with third party servers like Twilio and WhatsApp 
- **Server Development** writing the kind of code you'll be working on a day to day basis during your future tech job
- **Interview Topic** you'll have a unique project to discuss during your interviews

### Difficulty Level

- `Data structures` you must be familiar with arrays (lists), dictionaries, objects, and classes.
